# RS232 FARAD 1 FPGA Board
Implementation of RS232 protocol
#In writing this code, it is assumed that the input clock is equal to 50MHz. As a result, the clock period is equal to 20ns. For the transmitter and receiver, the baud rate value is considered equal to 9600bps, which is equivalent to the bit width of 1/9600=104.16μs. So each bit should be represented by 5208 clocks because: 104.16μs/20ns=5208. This value is placed in the Baud_Rate_9600 signal. The Bit_Width_Count counter is used to create the bit width corresponding to this baud rate.
#on the rising edge of the Send input signal, provided that the module is not busy; It means that it is not sending a packet, the bitrate value is calculated and the Busy signal is activated. In the next clock, the complete packet, including the Start and Stop bits, the priority bit and the desired byte to be sent, is created. In the next clock, the sending phase starts and each of the bits of the complete packet is placed on the serial output of the module for 5208 clocks. After every complete eleven-bit packet is sent, the Busy signal is disabled and a logical value of one is placed on the output serial port until the Send signal is received again.
